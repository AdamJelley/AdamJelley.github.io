Iâ€™m a PhD student in the [Bayesian and Neural Systems group](https://www.bayeswatch.com/) at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [Professor Amos Storkey](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/) in the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics).

My research is focused on developing more sample efficient deep reinforcement learning approaches via the application of recent self-supervised techniques, particularly contrastive learning, to learn a suitable representation for control. I'm supported by a [Microsoft Research Scholarship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-scholarship-europe-middle-east-africa/).
