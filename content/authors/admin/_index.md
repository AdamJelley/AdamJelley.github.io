Iâ€™m a PhD student in the [Bayesian and Neural Systems group](https://www.bayeswatch.com/) at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [Professor Amos Storkey](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/) in the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) and externally by [Sam Devlin](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sadevlin/) at [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/).

My research is broadly focused on developing more sample efficient reinforcement learning approaches, via the application of self-supervised approaches and by utilising offline data. I'm generally interested in improving the scientific understanding of deep reinforcement learning, bridging the gap between academia and industry, and the application of reinforcement learning to beneficial real-world problems and production software. I'm supported by a [Microsoft Research Scholarship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-scholarship-europe-middle-east-africa/).
