Iâ€™m a PhD student in the Bayesian and Neural Systems group at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Professor Amos Storkey in the School of Informatics and Dr Katja Hoffman at Microsoft Research Cambridge.

My research is focused on developing more sample efficient deep reinforcement learning algorithms to improve the performance of systems making automated decisions.
