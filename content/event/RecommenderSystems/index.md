summary: Using transfer learning to generate image-based features for a recommendation engine.
abstract: In this talk I explain how Dataiku improved an online vacation retailerâ€™s recommender system by leveraging pre-trained deep learning models to derive user preference information from images. This transfer learning approach can enable companies to use state-of-the-art machine learning methods without having deep learning expertise.
