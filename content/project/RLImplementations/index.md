Reimplementations of various reinforcement learning algorithms:
- [Actor-crtic](https://github.com/AdamJelley/Actor-Critic-Agents)
- [Value-based](https://github.com/AdamJelley/Deep-Q-Learning-Agents) (Q-learning)
- [Unsupervised](https://github.com/AdamJelley/Curiosity-A3C-Agent) (reward-free i.e. curiosity)
